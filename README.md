# CellTransport

Two models compete to explain the way proteins transit through the Golgi, a cellular organelle consisting of stacked membrane-bound compartments (cisternae) and responsible for protein maturation and sorting. The cisternal maturation model proposes that cisternae created de novo move through the stack, carrying their content with them. The vesicular transport model views cisternae as static structures between which proteins are exchanged by vesicular transport. WThis is the mathematical model that can quantify the importance of intercisternal exchange by analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of a protein distribution within the Golgi.

The model was based on "Quantitative analysis of intra-Golgi transport shows intercisternal exchange for all cargo" and the project is in process. It uses genetic algorithms.
